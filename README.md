# SECJ1013-PROGRAMMING-TECHNIQUE-1

### Reflection of this course
For me as a student, learning the fundamentals of C++ programming has been similar to learning a new language. I began by learning basic skills like writing programs and utilizing variables to store data. Seeing how I can give the machine the appropriate instructions to achieve what I want is amazing. Learning about conditions and loops has been similar to learning tips to improve the intelligence and efficiency of my programs. Even if it's not always simple, every little accomplishment feels like progressing to a new game level. I'm excited to use these foundations to create more engaging and practical programs in the future.
